Build a modern one-page website for Regal Star Gym – Wave & Vibe Pool Party with the following requirements:

Design Style

Black and gold premium theme.

Use the Regal Star Gym logo (I will upload the logo file after generation).

Layout should be clean, minimal, and mobile-responsive.

Smooth section fading and subtle animations.

Sections on the Page

Hero Section:
Large Regal Star Gym logo, event date, event theme, venue, and a “Purchase Ticket” button.

Event Details Section:
Show information:
• Date: Saturday, 7th December 2025
• Time: 12 PM
• Venue: Gladman Hotel, No 2b Udouweme Street, off Abak Road, Uyo
• Early Bird: Guys 5K, Ladies 3K
• Gate: @Venue 8K
• Fun games, music, community activities

Payment Section:
Integrate Flutterwave payment for ticket purchase.
After successful payment, automatically:
• Generate a PDF receipt
• Include a unique Ticket ID Number (e.g., “RSG-PPOOL-XXXXXX”)
• Email the receipt to the user
The site should store:
• Name
• Email
• Ticket ID
• Payment status
(Use a simple JSON or lightweight database, whichever is easier.)

Sponsors Section:
A blank placeholder grid titled “Our Sponsors” that I can manually update later (no logos for now).

Footer:
Regal Star Gym ownership footer + contact numbers for sponsorship:
08145036786 | 09038114850

Technical Requirements

Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only.

Use a simple backend using Node.js + Express for:
• Handling payment callback
• Generating unique ticket IDs
• Generating PDF receipts
• Sending confirmation email with PDF attached

PDF can be generated using any lightweight library (jspdf, pdf-lib, or similar).

Email should be sent using nodemailer.

Payment success page should show: “Payment Successful. Your ticket has been emailed.”

Project Structure
Create the following files:

index.html

styles.css

script.js

server.js

/public directory (for logo and assets)

/tickets directory (store generated PDFs)

package.json (include express, nodemailer, pdf library)

Final Output

A fully functioning one-page event ticket website

Black-and-gold branding

Flutterwave integration

Auto PDF ticket generation

Ticket ID system

Email delivery

Sponsor placeholder section

Clean UI, simple animations
